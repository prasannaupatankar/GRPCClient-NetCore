# gRPC client with Net Core

This is a sample application created with Net Core to consume a gRPC service. It can be used to understand the basic concept of the gRPC server and client interaction.

## Installing / Getting started

First, you need to start the server application (Link below). Once the server is started you can run the client application. The Server will supposedly run on 'https://localhost:5001', if your server is running on some other port, kindly change the URL accordingly.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* The application demonstrates gRPC client in working with .Net Core.
* It calls a  gPRC service that allows the application to Post 'Company' details.
